** Plan

1. Read three months of first direct joint account data, assigning a
   person to each transaction.

** How to do it

*** Rules

Maintain a file, ~rules.rkt~, in the statement directory, which gives a
person for each exact match.

*** Persons

Maintain a file, ~persons.rkt~ in config, that lists:

- all individual persons (as strings) together with
  - a short name (one that works in the context of their category)
  - their primary category (as a symbol)

- the hierarchy of categories of persons (as symbols)
