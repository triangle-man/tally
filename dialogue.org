I'm trying to keep track of my accounts. I've bought a notebook to record all my
transactions.

For example, here we are in the checkout of this popular supermarket chain. I
have bought an apple for 30p, which I'm paying for using Apple Pay.

So in my book I write down:

| Date     | Expense              | Amount |
|----------+----------------------+--------|
| Thursday | Apples (Sainsbury's) |   0.30 |

That's a good start! But you should write down that this came from your bank
account. my experience is that when it comes time to summarise your expenses, it
is very useful to have a cross-check. In this case, your bank balance at the end
of the month should differ from the balance at the end of the previous month by
the different of deposits and withdrawals. And the same should be true of your
cash on hand.


SAGREDO
Ah, very sensible. So I shall write thus:

| Date     | Expense            | From         | Amount |
|----------+--------------------+--------------+--------|
| Thursday | Food (Sainsbury's) | Bank account |   0.30 |

But now, come to think of it, I am taking money /from/ my bank and giving it
/to/ Sainsbury's; so for consistency I should presumably write:

| Date     | From         | To          | Reason      | Amount |
|----------+--------------+-------------+-------------+--------|
| Thursday | Bank account | Sainsbury's | Bought food |   0.30 |

This must be that “double entry” thing you talk about? I debit one person and
credit another.


SALVIATI
Ah, well, hm; no, it is not quite that.

You are right that you will need two places; or two “accounts,” as we say. But
the second one is an expense account called “Food,” rather than “Sainsbury's.”
