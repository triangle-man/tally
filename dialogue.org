Hello, Salviati! My good friend Simplicio has asked me to help him
keep track of his money as he doesn't know where it all goes. I
thought I would start by keeping my own records and, since you are the
expert, I was hoping to solicit your advice.

I've bought a notebook to record all my transactions.

For example, here we are in the checkout of this popular supermarket
chain. I have bought an apple for 30p, which I'm paying for using
Apple Pay.

So in my book I write down:

| Date     | Expense              | Amount |
|----------+----------------------+--------|
| Thursday | Apples (Sainsbury's) |   0.30 |


SALVIATI

That's a good start! But you should write down that the money came out
of your bank account.

My experience is that when it comes time to summarise your expenses,
it is very useful to have a cross-check. In this case, your bank
balance at the end of the month should differ from the balance at the
end of the previous month by the different of deposits and
withdrawals. And the same should be true of your cash on hand.


SAGREDO

Ah, indeed, very sensible. I can see that I was right to ask for your
counsel! So I shall write thus:

| Date     | Expense            | From         | Amount |
|----------+--------------------+--------------+--------|
| Thursday | Food (Sainsbury's) | Bank account |   0.30 |

But now, come to think of it, I am taking money /from/ my bank and
giving it /to/ Sainsbury's. So, for consistency I should presumably
write:

| Date     | From         | To          | Reason      | Amount |
|----------+--------------+-------------+-------------+--------|
| Thursday | Bank account | Sainsbury's | Bought food |   0.30 |

This must be that “double entry” thing you talk about? I “debit” one
person and “credit” another. How neatly it works out!


SALVIATI

Ah, well, hm; no, it is not quite that.

You are right that you will need two places; or two “accounts,” as we
say. The first one, your bank account, is a personal account. But the
second one is not a person, or a company like “Sainsbury’s,” it is an
/expense account/ called “Food.” We call these /nominal accounts/.

Let me write this as we do in the “journal”:

| Date     | Memo          | Account             | Debit | Credit |
|----------+---------------+---------------------+-------+--------|
| Thursday | /Sainsbury's/ |                     |       |        |
|----------+---------------+---------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               | Assets:Bank account |       |   0.30 |
|          |               | Expenses:Food       |  0.30 |        |
|----------+---------------+---------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               |                     |  0.30 |   0.30 |

This is a /transaction/. We record both the debits and the credits and
the total of each must be equal to the other. (/That/ is why it's
called “double entry.”)


SAGREDO

I see. Well, I /sort/ of see, Salviati, and I sort of don't at the
same time.

There are now two lines in this single transaction ... well, perhaps
there might be more than two lines --- if, somehow, a third party were
engaged in our transaction --- and in that case, it would no longer be
the case that I would write the very same number twice. So I
understand why you would write one under the other.


SALVIATA

Exactly, Sagredo! Sometimes the transaction involves more than two
accounts, especially if tax is involved.


SAGREDO

And so then every account is either a personal account or a nominal
account?


SALVIATA

No, there are also /real accounts/, which are either solid, tangible
things, such as houses or cars; or intangible things such as patents.


SAGREDO

I am not sure I see the common theme there. And I am still confused as
to why “Sainsbury’s” is now a memo item but my bank is not. Of course,
Sainsbury's don't send me a statement every month! Though ... perhaps
one day, when everything is computerised, I /will/ receive a similar
summary of my transactions with them. Certainly I will not receive a
statement from the apples!


SAVLIATA

Very droll, Sagredo! Still, this is the way it is done.


SAGREDO

Well, let's try some variations. What if I were to /steal/ the apple?
I presume, since I spent no money, the situation would look like this:

| Date     | Memo          | Account       | Debit | Credit |
|----------+---------------+---------------+-------+--------|
| Thursday | /Sainsbury's/ |               |       |        |
|----------+---------------+---------------+-------+--------|
|          |               | Expenses:Food |  0.30 |        |
|----------+---------------+---------------+-------+--------|
|          |               |               |  0.30 |        |

Hm. Now the transaction no longer balances? Also, it's not really an
expense. How should I record this?


SALVIATA

I presume you are not serious about the theft! Indeed, as you so
perspicaciously observe, this transaction does not balance and so it
is illegal in more ways than one.

I confess I struggle to account for this transaction ... well, it is
clear that you have /profited/ from the sudden arrival of an apple
with no attendant expense. So we should write:

| Date     | Memo          | Account                 | Debit | Credit |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
| Thursday | /Sainsbury's/ |                         |       |        |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               | Income:Immoral earnings |       |   0.30 |
|          |               | Assets:Apples           |  0.30 |        |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               |                         |  0.30 |   0.30 |

You see! The system works! You have acquired an asset: to wit, an
apple. So we must debit the corresponding asset account. And you have
also profited thereby (albeit immorally) so we credit the
corresponding income account.


SAGREDO

Now you have lost me. I believe I performed one /fewer/ actions than
previously, yet now there are /two/ entirely new accounts! Are you
saying I must perforce track the number of apples I have?


SALVIATA

Ah, well, no. I mean, yes, actually you should track the apples; but
since you eat them straight away---I see you have eaten this one
already---there's not really much point in doing so. Nonetheless, you
make a good point and I see I was a little hasty. Indeed, starting
from the above we might say that eating the apple credits the asset
account and debits the expense account, so that net effect is:

| Date     | Memo          | Account                 | Debit | Credit |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
| Thursday | /Sainsbury's/ |                         |       |        |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               | Income:Immoral earnings |       |   0.30 |
|          |               | Expenses:Food           |  0.30 |        |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-------+--------|
|          |               |                         |  0.30 |   0.30 |

There: balance is restored.
