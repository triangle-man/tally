Read and parse raw statements 

A statement is a file containing favours from the perspective of a particular person. A raw statement
is one where the other side(s) of the transactions or the reason may be uncertain. This is the case
with most bank statements, for example.

Bank: first direct

Format: Downloaded csv statements
As of:  29 July 2023

The first line of this file is the string:
"Date,Description,Amount,Balance"

Each subsequent line is of the form:

DD/MM/YYYY,SS..SSTT..TT,99.99,99.99

If the field SS..SSTT..TT is not more than 18 characters, then it should be read as a single
description. If it is longer than 18 characters, then the first 18 characters are a description
(which may be truncated or may be right-padded with spaces) and the remaining characters are a
reference.

The first numeric field is the transaction amount (positive for a deposit; negative for a payment or
withdrawal). The final field is the balance following this transaction.
